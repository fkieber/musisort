# musisort
Make your music mix from multiple sources



This python 2 script takes the contents of several directories 
containing Music and merges it into another directory.

The merge is done to take a file from each SOURCE directory,
and place them in the DEST directory.

## Usage

```
usage: musisort [-h] [-V] [-1] [-s] [-f] [-u | -e] [-v] [-d DEST]
                [-r [REPEAT [REPEAT ...]]] [-j [JUMBLE [JUMBLE ...]]]
                [-a ARTIST] [-t ALBUM] [-i TITLE] [-m FILE_NAME] [-z]
                SOURCES [SOURCES ...]

positional arguments:
  SOURCES               Input directory(s). Only music files
                         (* .mp3, * .flac, * .ogg, * .aac) of the SOURCES directories
                         are treated.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -V, --version         show program's version number and exit
  -1, --once            Do not complete DEST by duplicating the
                        SOURCES if there are not enough of them.
  -s, --stack           Stack files instead of inserting them.
                        Start with all files from SOURCES1
                        continues with those of SOURCES2, etc.
  -f, --force           Forces the DEST files to be overwritten.
  -u, --utf             Encoding of names in UTF-8 format.
  -e, --latin           Encoding of names in LATIN-1 format.
  -v, --verbose         Display of additional information. May be
                        repeated to display more information.
  -d DEST, --dest DEST  Destination of sorting. If DEST is a directory, the
                        SOURCE files are copied to it. If this
                        parameter is absent, the current directory is
                        taken. If this directory does not exist, use
                        the --force option to create it. If this directory
                        contains files, use the --force option to
                        replace them. If DEST is a .m3u or .m3u8 file
                        a playlist will be created based on
                        the extension. If this file exists, use the option
                        --force to replace it
  -r [REPEAT [REPEAT ...]], --repeat [REPEAT [REPEAT ...]]
                        Repeat the input directories. Each
                        digit represents the number of times a
                        SOURCES directory must be
                        repeted again. By default, only one
                        time. If you want to repeat the second
                        directory, for example, you must specified 1 for the
                        First (-r 1 2).
  -j [JUMBLE [JUMBLE ...]], --jumble [JUMBLE [JUMBLE ...]]
                        Scramble input directories. Each number
                        represents the SOURCES directory
                        mix. Directories not specified in this
                        list are sorted by filename.
                         
tags:
  List of tags to modify. Allows you to reassign the value of "Tags".
  This option is a string composed of several
  characters. %a=artist, %t=album title, %n=track number,
  %i=song title, %s=sequence number generated by the program.
  It starts with 1 and is incremented for each file. This
  makes it possible to respect the sort order. The other characters are
  interpreted as such. (These options have no effect in case of exit
  yo a .m3u or .m3u8 list).

  -a ARTIST, --artist ARTIST
                        New value for the 'artist' tag.
  -t ALBUM, --album ALBUM
                        New value for the tag 'album title'. By default
                        "Musisort".
  -i TITLE, --title TITLE
                        New value for the tag name of the song.
                        Defaults to "%s_%i -%a".
  -m FILE_NAME, --file-name FILE_NAME
                        New value for file name. String of
                        characters with which the file will be renamed. The
                        file will retain its extension. By default the
                        file will be named "%s_%i -%a".
  -z, --clear_tags      Specifies whether the "Tags" of DEST files should
                        Be deleted before storing the new Tag.
```

## Implementation

Just put the scrypt in /usr/local/bin fo rexemple.
